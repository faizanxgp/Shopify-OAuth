# Example

This example shows you how you can use `shopify-token` with `express`.

To run it, edit the `config.json` file and add the client credentials, then
install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

After this you can start the server using `node index.js`. When the server is
running, point your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
